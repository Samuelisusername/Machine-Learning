"Thoroughly enjoyable musicianship and music!,"These guys are going full steam ahead. This latest effort doesn't disappoint one bit compared to their earlier material. While almost every track has a really catchy melody and/or hook, this is progressive rock at it's finest. The group delivers a broad array of music and is reminiscent of prog groups of the past, but no matter what's going on they're always Spock's Beard."
